For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1a.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> As described in our preregistered data-analysis plan, we used 3 (policy frame) × 2 (policy sector) mixed  analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to evaluate the effects of  policy support and each leader’s moral character.

> Policy  support. The  results  revealed  a  main  effect  of  policy frame, F(2, 371) = 4.92, p = .008, ηp2 = .03, replicating the results of the pilot study. Participants were more supportive of policies framed in moral terms (M = 5.82, SD  =  0.74)  than  of  policies  framed  in  pragmatic  terms  (M = 5.54, SD = 0.72), t(246) = 3.08, p = .002, d = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.14, 0.64]. Policy support in the ambiguous frame fell in the middle (M = 5.70, SD = 0.70) and did not significantly differ from either the moral frame condition or the pragmatic frame condition (both ps  >  .071).  We  also  found  an  unexpected  main  effect  of  policy  sector;  participants  were  more  supportive  of  policies in the private sector (M = 5.72, SD = 0.77) than of those in the public sector (M = 5.65, SD = 0.84), F(1, 371) = 4.09, p = .044, ηp2 = .01, d = 0.21, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.41].  The  interaction  between  policy  frame  and  policy  sector  did  not  attain  statistical  significance,  F(2,  371)  =  2.86, p = .059.
